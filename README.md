A comprehensive Python library for controlling Universal Robots (UR) arms through Real-Time Data Exchange (RTDE). Supports both simulation environments and physical robots with built-in safety features.

![RobotArm](images/ursim_pipeline_1.png)

## What This Project Does

This library lets you **control Universal Robots** (those 6-axis robot arms) using Python code. You can:

- **Control robot movements**: Make the robot move to specific positions, follow paths, or apply forces
- **Work with simulation**: Practice and test your code safely using a virtual robot
- **Connect to real robots**: Control actual UR robots in factories, labs, or workshops  
- **Run command sequences**: Execute pre-programmed movement sequences from files
- **Stay safe**: Built-in safety checks prevent dangerous movements on real robots

**Perfect for**: Robotics students, researchers, automation engineers, or anyone wanting to program UR robots!

## System Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+), Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+
- **Robot Hardware**: Universal Robots e-Series (UR3e, UR5e, UR10e, UR16e, UR20) or URSim
- **Network**: Ethernet connection to robot (for physical robots)
- **Docker**: Required for simulation mode

## 📖 Complete Guide: From Beginner to Advanced

### 🎯 **Step 1: Understanding the Basics**

**What is RTDE?** Real-Time Data Exchange - it's the communication protocol that lets your computer talk to UR robots.

**Simulation vs Physical Robot:**
- **Simulation**: Practice with a virtual robot on your computer (safe, free, no hardware needed)
- **Physical Robot**: Control real UR robots (requires actual robot hardware and network connection)

### 🎮 **Step 2: Start with Simulation (Recommended)**

The simulator lets you test everything safely before touching real robots.

```bash
# Run this to start the virtual robot
./scripts/startDocker.sh
```
**What this does**: Downloads and starts a virtual UR robot that runs in Docker

```bash
# Open this website to see your virtual robot
# Navigate to: http://localhost:6080/vnc.html
```
**What you'll see**: A web-based interface showing a 3D robot that you can control

**One-time setup in simulator:**
1. Click "Confirm Safety Configuration" (acknowledges you understand robot safety)
2. Turn ON "Simulation" switch (bottom right - enables simulation mode)
3. Go to Program → Graphics (shows the robot visually)
4. Go to Move → Press "ON" → Press "START" (starts the robot program)
5. Return to Program → Graphics (go back to visual view)

Note: PDF in `docs/` folder has visual instructions if needed. Keep this simulator window open!

### 🧪 **Step 3: Test Your Setup**

Open a **new terminal** (keep simulator running) and test these commands:

```bash
# Activate your Python environment
source ur_venv/bin/activate

# Test 1: Check if robot is ready
python scripts/check_robot_status.py
```
**What this does**: Connects to robot and shows its current status (position, safety mode, etc.)

```bash
# Test 2: Make the robot move visually  
python scripts/visual_test.py
```
**What this does**: Moves the robot slowly so you can see it moving in the simulator web interface

```bash
# Test 3: Run basic examples
python examples/basic_example.py
```
**What this does**: Demonstrates different types of robot movements (linear, relative, velocity control)

### 🤖 **Step 4: Understanding Physical Robot Connection**

**Requirements for Physical Robots:**
- UR robot (UR3e, UR5e, UR10e, UR16e, or UR20)
- Ethernet cable connecting your computer to the robot
- Robot must be in "Remote Control" mode
- "External Control" URCap installed on robot

**Find your robot on the network:**
```bash
python scripts/setup_physical_robot.py --scan
```
**What this does**: Scans your network to find UR robots and shows their IP addresses

**Test connection to specific robot:**
```bash
python scripts/setup_physical_robot.py --test-ip 192.168.1.100
```
**What this does**: Tests if you can communicate with a robot at that IP address

**Connect to physical robot:**
```bash
python examples/basic_example.py --robot-type physical --robot-ip 192.168.1.100
```
**What this does**: Runs the same examples but on a real robot instead of simulator

## 🔧 **Available Scripts and What They Do**

### 📁 **examples/** - Learn by doing
```bash
# Basic robot control (connects, moves, disconnects)
python examples/basic_example.py
# Shows: connection testing, linear movements, velocity control

```

### 📂 **legacy/** - Original working examples
```bash
# Your original working scripts (preserved for reference)
python legacy/ur_example.py          # Basic UR robot examples
python legacy/ur_synchronous.py      # Sequential command execution  
python legacy/ur_asynchronous.py     # Streaming command execution
```

## 💡 **How to Write Your Own Robot Code**

Instead of starting from scratch, you can use this library in your own Python programs:

```python
# This is example code you can copy and modify
from src.ur_controller import URRobotController

# Connect to robot (simulator or physical)
robot = URRobotController(
    robot_ip="127.0.0.1",        # Use 127.0.0.1 for simulator
    robot_type="simulation"       # Use "physical" for real robots
)

if robot.connect():
    print("Robot connected!")
    
    # Get where robot currently is
    current_position = robot.get_tcp_pose()
    print(f"Robot is at: {current_position}")
    
    # Move robot 10cm to the right
    robot.move_linear_relative([0.1, 0, 0], speed=0.1)
    
    robot.disconnect()
else:
    print("Could not connect to robot")
```

**Why use this approach?** This library handles all the complex communication with the robot, so you can focus on what you want the robot to do, not how to talk to it.

## 📋 **Command Files: Pre-Programming Robot Movements**

You can create files with robot movements and run them later:

**Create a file called `my_movements.jsonl`:**
```json
{"dx": 0.05, "dy": 0.0, "dz": 0.0}
{"dx": 0.0, "dy": 0.05, "dz": 0.0}  
{"dx": 0.0, "dy": 0.0, "dz": 0.05}
```

**Run the movements:**
```bash
python examples/synchronous_control.py --json-source my_movements.jsonl
```

**What each line means:**
- `dx, dy, dz`: Move in X, Y, Z directions (in meters)
- `drx, dry, drz`: Rotate around X, Y, Z axes (in radians)

## ⚙️ **Configuration Files: Save Robot Settings**

Create `my_robot_config.yaml` to save settings:
```yaml
robot:
  type: "physical"           # or "simulation"  
  ip: "192.168.1.100"       # your robot's IP address
  model: "UR10e"            # your robot model

movement:
  default_speed: 0.1        # how fast robot moves (m/s)
  default_acceleration: 0.3 # how quickly it speeds up (m/s²)
```

**Use your config:**
```bash
python examples/basic_example.py --config my_robot_config.yaml
```

### 🤔 **What is setup.py?**

`setup.py` is a special file that makes this project into a **proper Python package**. Think of it like creating an "installer" for your code.

**What it does:**
- Lets you install this robot controller as a system-wide Python package
- Makes it easy to share your code with others
- Handles dependencies automatically
- Creates command-line tools

**How to use it:**
```bash
# Install this package system-wide (optional)
pip install -e .

# After installing, you can use it from anywhere:
python -c "from src.ur_controller import URRobotController; print('Package installed!')"
```

**Do you need it?** No! You can use everything without running setup.py. It's just for advanced users who want to install the package properly.

## 🤖 **Complete Physical Robot Setup Guide**

### 📋 **Prerequisites**
- UR robot (UR3e, UR5e, UR10e, UR16e, or UR20)
- Ethernet cable
- Computer connected to same network as robot
- Robot powered on and safety configured

### 🔌 **Step 1: Physical Connection**

**Option A: Direct Connection**
1. Connect ethernet cable from your computer directly to robot's ethernet port
2. Set your computer's IP to `192.168.1.XXX` (where XXX is 1-254, but not 100)
3. Robot will typically be at `192.168.1.100`

**Option B: Network Connection**
1. Connect robot to your local network via ethernet
2. Robot will get IP address from your router (check robot's teach pendant for IP)
3. Your computer must be on same network

### 🖥️ **Step 2: Robot Configuration**

**On the robot's teach pendant:**
1. Go to **Settings** → **System** → **Network**
2. Note the IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
3. Go to **Settings** → **Features** → **External Control**
4. Install **External Control URCap** if not already installed
5. Create a simple program:
   ```
   BeforeStart:
   1. External Control (localhost, 50002)
   
   Robot Program:
   1. External Control (localhost, 50002) 
   ```
6. Save this program as "External_Control"

### 🔍 **Step 3: Test Connection**

```bash
# Find your robot on the network
python scripts/setup_physical_robot.py --scan
```
**Expected output:**
```
🔍 Scanning for UR robots...
Found robot at: 192.168.1.100 (UR10e)
```

```bash
# Test specific robot connection
python scripts/setup_physical_robot.py --test-ip 192.168.1.100
```
**Expected output:**
```
✅ Connection successful to 192.168.1.100
✅ Robot mode: RUNNING
✅ Safety mode: NORMAL
```

### 🎮 **Step 4: Control Physical Robot**

```bash
# Run basic example with physical robot
python examples/basic_example.py --robot-type physical --robot-ip 192.168.1.100
```

**⚠️ SAFETY NOTES:**
- Always have emergency stop button ready
- Start with slow movements (speed=0.05)
- Keep clear of robot workspace
- Ensure robot workspace is free of obstacles
- Test in manual mode first

### 🛠️ **Troubleshooting Physical Connections**

**Can't find robot:**
```bash
# Check network connectivity
ping 192.168.1.100

# Check if robot ports are open
telnet 192.168.1.100 29999
```

**Robot not responding:**
1. Check robot is in **Remote Control** mode (teach pendant)
2. Verify **External Control** program is running
3. Check firewall settings on your computer
4. Ensure robot safety system is normal (no protective stops)

**Connection timeout:**
- Robot might be in wrong mode
- External Control URCap not properly configured
- Network issues (firewall, wrong IP)

### 📋 **Physical Robot Checklist**

Before running any script with physical robot:

- [ ] Robot is powered on and initialized
- [ ] Safety system shows normal status  
- [ ] Robot is in "Remote Control" mode
- [ ] External Control URCap is installed
- [ ] External Control program is loaded and running
- [ ] Network connection is established
- [ ] Emergency stop is accessible
- [ ] Workspace is clear of people and obstacles
- [ ] You've tested with simulator first

### 🔧 **Advanced: Custom Robot Configuration**

Create `my_physical_robot.yaml`:
```yaml
robot:
  type: "physical"
  ip: "192.168.1.100"  # Your robot's IP
  model: "UR10e"       # Your robot model
  frequency: 500.0

physical:
  safety:
    max_velocity: 0.2        # Slower for safety
    max_acceleration: 0.5    # Gentle acceleration
    workspace_limits:        # Define safe workspace
      x: [-0.8, 0.8]        # X limits in meters
      y: [-0.8, 0.8]        # Y limits in meters  
      z: [0.1, 1.5]         # Z limits in meters

movement:
  default_speed: 0.05       # Start slow!
  default_acceleration: 0.1
```

Use with any script:
```bash
python examples/basic_example.py --config my_physical_robot.yaml
```

## 🛠️ **Programming Reference (API)**

### URRobotController Class - Main Functions

| Function | What It Does | How To Use |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| `connect()` | Connect to robot | `robot.connect()` → Returns `True` if successful |
| `disconnect()` | Disconnect from robot | `robot.disconnect()` |
| `get_tcp_pose()` | Get robot's current position | `pose = robot.get_tcp_pose()` → Returns `[x,y,z,rx,ry,rz]` |
| `move_linear(pose, speed)` | Move to exact position | `robot.move_linear([0.3,-0.3,0.5,0,3.14,0], 0.1)` |
| `move_linear_relative(delta, speed)` | Move relative to current position | `robot.move_linear_relative([0.1,0,0], 0.1)` |
| `move_velocity(velocity, duration)` | Apply velocity for time period | `robot.move_velocity([0.05,0,0,0,0,0], 2.0)` |
| `stop_movement()` | Emergency stop | `robot.stop_movement()` |

### 📏 **Understanding Coordinates**

**Position format:** `[x, y, z, rx, ry, rz]`
- `x, y, z`: Position in meters (+ = right, forward, up)
- `rx, ry, rz`: Rotation in radians around each axis

**Example positions:**
```python
# 30cm right, 40cm back, 50cm up from robot base
position = [0.3, -0.4, 0.5, 0.0, 3.14, 0.0]

# Move 10cm to the right from current position  
relative_move = [0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```
